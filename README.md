# Image Segmentation
Project objectives:
- Understand the Segmentation Dataset and write a custom dataset class for Image-Mask dataset.

- Apply segmentation augmentation to augment images as well as their masks. For image-mask augmentation, use albumentation library, then plot the image-mask pair.

- Load a pre-trained state-of-the art convolutional neural network for segmentation problems (e.g., U-net) using segmentation model in PyTorch library.

- Create a train and evaluate function which is helpful to use training loop to train the model.
